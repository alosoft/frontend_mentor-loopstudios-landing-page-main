## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

There was a fair amount of CSS positioning in all the sections except the footer in this challenge.
The Grid layout too wasn't complex so I'd say this challenge difficulty was alright.
